# "Travel Journal" for Learn React for free course by *Bob Ziroll*

- Just like with the **Digital Business Card** project, I decided to set up a React project with create-react-app in order to start working within a more real enviroment instead of doing the project on the **Scrimba** website.

- The objective was to match the following travel journal site: https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0%3A1

- I'm not much of a traveler due to not having enough money, so instead of copying the site with the same locations or with different
real world ones, I instead thought of something cooler: doing something based aroun *Bloodborne*, one of my favourite videogames of all
time! Looks way more original, right?

- Same as before: this mini project was made in order to practice basic **React** concepts, which I found pretty intuitive to grasp thanks to my past use of *Webpack* and modules in **The Odin Project's** Vanilla Javascript course. This time, I learned about passing props to the components in order to avoid repeating code. The most difficult part was to match the CSS formatting, though *Figma* proved quite an interesting tool in order to help get done with the visual aspect in a quick way.
