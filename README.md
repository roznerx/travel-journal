# "Travel Journal" for Learn React for free course by *Bob Ziroll*

- Just like with the **Digital Business Card** project, I decided to set up a React project with create-react-app in order to start working within a more real enviroment instead of doing the project on the **Scrimba** website.

- The objective was to match the following travel journal site: https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0%3A1

- Same as before: this mini project was made in order to practice basic **React** concepts, which I found pretty intuitive to grasp thanks to my past use of *Webpack* and modules in **The Odin Project's** Vanilla Javascript course. This time, I learned about passing props to the components in order to avoid repeating code. The most difficult part was to match de CSS formatting, though *Figma* proved quite an interesting tool in order to help get done with the visual aspect in a quick way.

- You can check it out at [COMING SOON]
